## Bigram

This code was inspired on Andrej Karpathy's [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo)

The code of Bigram can be found at [Bigram.py](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Bigram/Bigram.py)

The code of Perplexity can be found at [Perplexity.py](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Bigram/Perplexity.py)

Here you will also find a notebook file [Bigram.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Bigram/Bigram.ipynb) that shows how to train the bigram and how to compute the perplexity.

To run the bigram I used the tokenizer that I trained in with the BPE algorithm. The pickle file of the tokenizer can be found at [tokenizer5000+specials.pkl](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Bigram/tokenizer5000%2Bspecials.pkl)
