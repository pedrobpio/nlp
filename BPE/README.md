## BPE

This code was based on Andrej Karpathy's [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=392s)

The code of BPE algorithm can be found at [BPE.py](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/BPE/BPE.py)

Here you will also find two notebooks files. Those files shows how to use the class inside [BPE.py](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/BPE/BPE.py)

The two files are similar, the main diference is the number of tokens that it was trained to have. [training500](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/BPE/training500.ipynb) trains the tokenizer to have 500 tokens while [training1000](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/BPE/training1000.ipynb) trains the tokenizer to have 1000 tokens

I also inclused the tokenizer object for the [training 500](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/BPE/tokenizer500.pkl)and for [training 1000](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/BPE/tokenizer1000.pkl) as pickle files
