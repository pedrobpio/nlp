## Classification

At this folder we are implementing basic classification on text using NB, Logistic regression and KNN

For that, we are also imlementing a grid search in the hiperparameters
the code containing the hiperparameters optimization class with the grid-search for each classifier can be found  [find_best_hyperparameters.py](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Classification/find_best_hyperparameters.py). at the same class you can train and run the best models found with the grid-search.

you can also find a notebook exemple on how to use it at:

[Find_best_hiperparams.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Classification/find_best_hyperparameters.py)

The datasets can be found at the [data folder](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/tree/main/Classification/Data)

While the grid search results can be found at the [Grid_search folder](https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/tree/main/Classification/Grid_results)
