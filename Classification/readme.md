## Classification

At this folder we are implementing basic classification on text using NB, Logistic regression and KNN

For that, we are also imlementing a grid search in the hiperparameters
the code containing the classes on the hiperparameters optimization with the grid-search on each classifier can be found  (find_best_hyperparameters.py)[https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Classification/find_best_hyperparameters.py]

Here you will also find how to use each classifier in on its respectives ipynb files:

(run_NB)[https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Classification/run_NB.ipynb]
(run_LR)[https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Classification/run_LR.ipynb]
(run_KNN)[https://github.com/pedrobpio/nlp/blob/main/Classification/run_KNN.ipynb]

we also saved several CSV containing the results of the gris search hiper_parameter optimizations.
